# Qv2ray-config-to-TransparentProxy

Normal Qv2ray cannot get things done at some situations. Sometimes a transparent proxy is essential.

I successfully use this method to built a transparent proxy: https://toutyrater.github.io/app/tproxy.html

Thanks, ToutyRater.

This python script converts Qv2ray config file to fit the transparent proxy requirements.
